    "description":"This image is from a copy of Great Book of Kings called ‘The Shahnama’ written by Firdawsi in the 11th century. It contains epic stories of the rulers and kings of Greater Iran. Written in Persian, it has been translated multiple times into different languages. This exemplary poem has been compared to the Great Indian Mythological epic ‘Mahabharata’.The book is an idealized representation of royal authority, legitimacy and grand royal duty. Among the many stories of other kings and rulers, one of these legendary stories was that of Iskandar, commonly known as Alexander the Great. This image shows Iskandar and The Talking Tree, which is one of the finest and greatest legends from the Shahnama. It depicts Iskandar arriving at one of the worldly wonders, on his journey and entering the land of talking trees with male and female heads. The Wise Tree shown here has both human and animal heads which heralds the death of a king in a foreign land far from his kingdom and family.\" (National Museum of Asian Art 2020))"},

    "description":"The talking tree is one of the sacred trees with mythological significance. It has roots in Western countries such as China, India, and parts of Europe. One such mythical tale of this giant tree comes from Indo-Persian lore which is known as the 'Waqwaq tree', whose fruits are shaped like men, women, and animal heads. In another Persian story, this tree is described as 'Wak Wak', and it possesses the ability to speak. According to yet another story, the heads are hung from the tree and once they are detached, the tree becomes quiet and dies. However, in Firdawsi's version, the tree is unnamed. The tree trunk is made up of both a man and a woman, and its fruits are made up of various animal and human heads (Soltani and Saadatmand 2017,71-72)"},

    "description":"One of the significant moments in Shahnama is when Iskandar finds himself in Speaking Tree territory. When Iskandar and his troops approached, they hear human voices coming from the tree leaves. They hear a male voice say loudly, \"However much Sekandar wanders in the world, he has already seen his share of blessings: when he has reigned for fourteen years, he must quit the royal throne.\" Listening to this heartbreak words coming from tree, he retires in sadness and sleeps. Until the midnight, there was silence along with grief and suddenly the other trunk of the tree, the female side speaks \"Do not puff yourself up with greed; why torment your soul in this way? Greed makes you wander the wide world, harass mankind, and kill kings. But you are not long for this earth now; do not darken and deaden your days like this.\" Hearing his fate, Iskandar lastly asks the tree, \"Will this fateful day come in Greece; will my mother see me alive again, before someone covers my face in death?\" Then the speaking tree replies \"Few days remain; You must prepare your final baggage train. Neither your mother, nor your family,Nor the veiled women of your land will see Your face again. Death will come soon: you’ll die In a strange land, with strangers standing by. The stars and crown and throne and worldly glory Are sated with Sekandar and his story.\" (Davis 2016,668-669) This conversation hit Sekandar like a sword in his heart. He then collected gifts from the town’s nobility and leaves the town with heavy heart. Soon in another city, he dies."},

    "description":"The image from this folio does not depict the separated two trunks, but the manuscript does. In the painting, the tree is only showed with various animal heads but it speaks in male - female voices. North-Indian version of The Shahnama in The British Library is drawn exactly as it is written. The comparison image shows the left side of the tree with female heads and limbs. The trunk only speaks at night and smells like sweet musk. When Iskandar is resting under the tree at midnight, the female trunk foretells his fate and death She says, “Few days remain;You must prepare your final baggage train. Neither your mother, nor your family,Nor the veiled women of your land will see Your face again. Death will come soon: you’ll die In a strange land, with strangers standing by. The stars and crown and throne and worldly glory Are sated with Sekandar and his story.” (Davis 2016,668-669)"},

    "description":"Everything, like in Chinese culture, has two energies, Yin and Yang. It has a very powerful significance in their culture.  On that spectrum, they call the feminine side Yin and the masculine side Yang (Solomon 2010) Similarly, In the text the speaking tree has two sides: male and female. It depicts the right side of the speaking tree with male heads and limbs. During the day, the male trunk speaks, warning Iskandar about his pride and greed. The male tree informs Iskandar that he has seen his fair share of blessings and that it is time for him to abdicate his throne. (Davis 2016,668-669) While in the painting the right side has various animal heads differing from the story in the text."},

    "description":" At the time of making this manuscript, Persian paintings were heavily influenced by Chinese and Turkish cultures. These cultures were inextricably linked to nature. The drama of the clouds and the colours of the sky matched the Chinese art, and the face features resembled Turkish men, as seen in various folios from Shahnama. Similarly, these cultures recognised the value of natural creatures  and animals in their artwork. As a result, the Persian illustration of the story combined both human and animal heads on the tree. “From Firdawsi's point of view, the Talking Tree had two sides: humans and animals. They believe that like humans, a tree is a living organism, which possesses consciousness and understanding.This animism can also be seen in other elements of nature.” (Soltani and Saadatmand 2017, 73-74) Like humans and animals, trees have feelings and sense of understanding and that’s why the painting is shown with not just human features but animals aswell. Thus, every living organism like birds, plants, trees, animals and human beings are given equal importance and significance. "},
