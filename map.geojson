    "description":"This image is from a copy of Great Book of Kings called ‘The Shahnama’ written by Firdawsi in the 11th century. It contains epic stories of the rulers and kings of Greater Iran. Written in Persian, it has been translated multiple times into different languages. This exemplary poem has been compared to the Great Indian Mythological epic ‘Mahabharata’.The book is an idealized representation of royal authority, legitimacy and grand royal duty. Among the many stories of other kings and rulers, one of these legendary stories was that of Iskandar, commonly known as Alexander the Great. This image shows Iskandar and The Talking Tree, which is one of the finest and greatest legends from the Shahnama. It depicts Iskandar arriving at one of the worldly wonders, on his journey and entering the land of talking trees with male and female heads. The Wise Tree shown here has both human and animal heads which heralds the death of a king in a foreign land far from his kingdom and family.\" (National Museum of Asian Art 2020))"},

    "description":"The talking tree is one of the sacred trees with mythological significance. It has roots in Western countries such as China, India, and parts of Europe. One such mythical tale of this giant tree comes from Indo-Persian lore which is known as the 'Waqwaq tree', whose fruits are shaped like men, women, and animal heads. In another Persian story, this tree is described as 'Wak Wak', and it possesses the ability to speak. According to yet another story, the heads are hung from the tree and once they are detached, the tree becomes quiet and dies. However, in Firdawsi's version, the tree is unnamed. The tree trunk is made up of both a man and a woman, and its fruits are made up of various animal and human heads (Soltani and Saadatmand 2017,71-72)"},

    "description":"One of the significant moments in Shahnama is when Iskandar finds himself in Speaking Tree territory. When Iskandar and his troops approached, they hear human voices coming from the tree leaves. They hear a male voice say loudly, \"However much Sekandar wanders in the world, he has already seen his share of blessings: when he has reigned for fourteen years, he must quit the royal throne.\" Listening to this heartbreak words coming from tree, he retires in sadness and sleeps. Until the midnight, there was silence along with grief and suddenly the other trunk of the tree, the female side speaks \"Do not puff yourself up with greed; why torment your soul in this way? Greed makes you wander the wide world, harass mankind, and kill kings. But you are not long for this earth now; do not darken and deaden your days like this.\" Hearing his fate, Iskandar lastly asks the tree, \"Will this fateful day come in Greece; will my mother see me alive again, before someone covers my face in death?\" Then the speaking tree replies \"Few days remain; You must prepare your final baggage train. Neither your mother, nor your family,Nor the veiled women of your land will see Your face again. Death will come soon: you’ll die In a strange land, with strangers standing by. The stars and crown and throne and worldly glory Are sated with Sekandar and his story.\" (Davis 2016,668-669) This conversation hit Sekandar like a sword in his heart. He then collected gifts from the town’s nobility and leaves the town with heavy heart. Soon in another city, he dies."},

    "description":"The image from this folio doesn’t portray the segregated two trunks but the manuscript differs in the writing. According to the North Indian version of Shahnama in British Library, it is drawn as it is written. In the comparative picture, we see the left side of the tree with female heads and limbs. The female trunk speaks and smells like a sweet musk and speaks only at night. At midnight when Iskandar is resting under the tree, the female trunk is the one which foretells his fate and his death. She says, “Few days remain;You must prepare your final baggage train. Neither your mother, nor your family,Nor the veiled women of your land will see Your face again. Death will come soon: you’ll die In a strange land, with strangers standing by. The stars and crown and throne and worldly glory Are sated with Sekandar and his story.” (Davis 2016,668-669)"},

    "description":"Like in Chinese culture, every thing has two energies, the Yin and Yang. It holds a great significance in their culture and in that spectrum, they call the femine side- Yin and the masculine side - Yang (Solomon 2010) Similarly, The speaking tree has two sides- the male and female. The text depicts the right side of the speaking tree with male heads and limbs. The male trunk speaks during the day and in their tormented foreboding voice they warn Iskandar about his pride and greed of the throne. The male tree tells iskandar that he has seen his share of blessings and its time to quit his throne.  (Davis 2016,668-669)"},

    "description":" At the time of Ilkhanid dynasty, Persian paintings had great influence of Chinese and Turkish cultures. These cultures were closely interlinked with nature. As observed in various folios from Shahnama, the drama of clouds and the colours of the sky matched the chinese art and the face features resembled the turkish men. Similarly these cultures acknowledged the importance of  creatures of nature which included animals as an important element inn artwork. Thus the persian illustration of the story combined both animal heads and human heads on the tree. “From the perspective of Firdawsi, Talking tree had two sides- the humans and the animals. They believe that like humans, a tree is a living organism, which possesses consciousness and understanding.This animism can also be seen in other elements of nature.” (Soltani and Saadatmand 2017, 73-74)"},
