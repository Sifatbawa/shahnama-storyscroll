    "description":"Talking tree is one of the sacred trees and have mythological meaning behind it. It has roots from Western nations like China, India and some parts of Europe aswell. One such mythical tale of this giant tree is from Indo-Persian lore known as “Waqwaq” tree whose fruits are in shape of men and female and animal head. In another persian story this tree is called “Wak Wak” which has an ability to speak. An alternate story says that the heads are hung from the tree and when detached it is silenced and dead. But in Firdawsi’s version, The tree doesn’t have a specific name. The tree trunk is composed of both man and woman, and its fruits have heads of various animals and human that can predict the future.One side of the trunk which is female, smells sweet like musk and speaks during night time and during the day the male side speaks. In the Shahnama, The talking tree both from female and male side warns Iskandar about the pride of his throne and greed. After repeated warnings day and night, the tree prophesied his death and exact details about it. (Soltani and Saadatmand 2017,71-72)"},

    "description":"One of the epic poems of Shahnama is when Iskandar lands himself in the territory of Speaking Tree. Upon arrival, iskandar and his troop heard human voices which were coming from a tree leaves. They hear loud male voice saying, \"However much Sekandar wanders in the world, he has already seen his share of blessings: when he has reigned for fourteen years, he must quit the royal throne.\" Listening to this heartbreak words coming from tree, he retires in sadness and sleeps. Until the midnight, there was silence along with grief and suddenly the other trunk of the tree, the female side speaks \"Do not puff yourself up with greed; why torment your soul in this way? Greed makes you wander the wide world, harass mankind, and kill kings. But you are not long for this earth now; do not darken and deaden your days like this.\" Hearing his fate, Iskandar lastly asks the tree, \"Will this fateful day come in Greece; will my mother see me alive again, before someone covers my face in death?\" Then the speaking tree replies \"Few days remain; You must prepare your final baggage train. Neither your mother, nor your family,Nor the veiled women of your land will see Your face again. Death will come soon: you’ll die In a strange land, with strangers standing by. The stars and crown and throne and worldly glory Are sated with Sekandar and his story.\" (Davis 2016,668-669) This conversation hit Sekandar like a sword in his heart. He then collected gifts from the town’s nobility and leaves the town with heavy heart. Soon in another city, he dies."},

According to the North Indian version of Shahnama in British Library, it is drawn as it is written. In the comparative picture, we see the left side of the tree with female heads and limbs. The female trunk speaks and smells like a sweet musk and speaks only at night. At midnight when Iskandar is resting under the tree, the female trunk is the one which foretells his fate and his death. She says, “Few days remain;You must prepare your final baggage train. Neither your mother, nor your family,Nor the veiled women of your land will see Your face again. Death will come soon: you’ll die In a strange land, with strangers standing by. The stars and crown and throne and worldly glory Are sated with Sekandar and his story.” (Davis 2016,668-669)"},

    "description":"Like in Chinese culture, every thing has two energies, the Yin and Yang. It holds a great significance in their culture and in that spectrum, they call the femine side- Yin and the masculine side - Yang (Solomon 2010) Similarly, The speaking tree has two sides- the male and female. The text depicts the right side of the speaking tree with male heads and limbs. The male trunk speaks during the day and in their tormented foreboding voice they warn Iskandar about his pride and greed of the throne. The male tree tells iskandar that he has seen his share of blessings and its time to quit his throne.  (Davis 2016,668-669)"},
