    "description":"\"This image is from the Great Book of Kings called ‘The Shahnama’ written by Firdawsi in the 11th century. It contains national epic stories of the Rulers and Kings of Greater Iran. Written in Persian, ithas been translated multiple times into different languages. This exemplary poem is regarded in a manner that The Shahnama’s stature is compared to the Great Indian Mythological epic ‘Mahabharata’. “This book is an ideal expression of royal authority, legitimacy, and epic royal duty. Amongst numerous tales of other Kings and Rulers, One such legendary story was the Story of Iskandar, popularly known as Alexander the Great. This image depicts Iskandar and the Talking Tree which is one of the finest and greatest legends from the Shahnama. It depicts Iskandar’s arrival at one of the worldly wonders from his journey, where he walks into a land of speaking tree with male and female heads. The wise tree, shown here has both human and animal heads, which forecasts the death of the king in a strange land, away from his kingdom and family.” (National Museum of Asian Art 2020))"},

    "description":"\"Talking tree is one of the sacred trees and have mythological meaning behind it. It has roots from Western nations like China, India and some parts of Europe aswell. One such mythical tale of this giant tree is from Indo-Persian lore known as “Waqwaq” tree whose fruits are in shape of men and female and animal head. In another persian story this tree is called “Wak Wak” which has an ability to speak. An alternate story says that the heads are hung from the tree and when detached it is silenced and dead. But in Firdawsi’s version, The tree doesn’t have a specific name. The tree trunk is composed of both man and woman, and its fruits have heads of various animals and human that can predict the future.One side of the trunk which is female, smells sweet like musk and speaks during night time and during the day the male side speaks. In the Shahnama, The talking tree both from female and male side warns Iskandar about the pride of his throne and greed. After repeated warnings day and night, the tree prophesied his death and exact details about it.\" (Soltani and Saadatmand 2017,71-72)"},

Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
